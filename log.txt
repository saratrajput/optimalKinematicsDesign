Trying to make the script faster
	- removed the warning in function igm
	- changed returns of theta from Nan to empty array

Seems to run faster now
	- should use timer
	- Elapsed time is 27 seconds.
		- much faster than before.

Now should try to find the base from the given theta values and check how much 
of the work area it can cover from there.
	- created a new function findBase to do this.

Also find a dark theme for matlab.

Testing the new function findBase
	- findBase works well
	- no need of storing theta values now
	- Problems
		- right now findBase is only getting base for the first two theta values
	- algorithm runs much faster now - only 10 seconds

Next Step
	- find how many points the end effector can cover from the given base
		- need to fix the new base and calculate how many points it can reach in
		workArea

Should also check for the obstacles and make sure that the base returned are not
falling in the area defined by the obstacles.
	- trying a if statement with workMap(base1, base2) == 1 to decide to append
	base values or not.

New problem with findBase
	- it is returning values greater than the defined workArea i.e. 400x400

Currently having problem with non integer values in the array.
	- solved with using round before base1 and base2.


Next is to calculate how many squares each base position can cover.

Should also check for the obstacles.

How to plot a line.
	- line plot done.

Had problems with plotting dgm in the end. Was due to wrongly declared L2. 
	- should use global variables instead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ven 27 ott 2017, 08.57.54, CEST
Plotting done successfully. Plots like an animated plot.

Should plot all the best bases, and repeat the above plot for all the best 
bases.

Writing description for each function.

Last base position is not plotting.
Should check plot also for elbow down position.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lun 30 ott 2017, 10.45.12, CET
Done with plot for elbow down configuration.

Last base position does not plot for elbow up configuration but does for elbow 
down configuration.

Should include elbow up and down as function arguments.
