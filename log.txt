Trying to make the script faster
	- removed the warning in function igm
	- changed returns of theta from Nan to empty array

Seems to run faster now
	- should use timer
	- Elapsed time is 27 seconds.
		- much faster than before.

Now should try to find the base from the given theta values and check how much 
of the work area it can cover from there.
	- created a new function findBase to do this.

Also find a dark theme for matlab.

Testing the new function findBase
	- findBase works well
	- no need of storing theta values now
	- Problems
		- right now findBase is only getting base for the first two theta values
	- algorithm runs much faster now - only 10 seconds

Next Step
	- find how many points the end effector can cover from the given base
		- need to fix the new base and calculate how many points it can reach in
		workArea
