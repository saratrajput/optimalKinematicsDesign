Trying to make the script faster
	- removed the warning in function igm
	- changed returns of theta from Nan to empty array

Seems to run faster now
	- should use timer
	- Elapsed time is 27 seconds.
		- much faster than before.

Now should try to find the base from the given theta values and check how much 
of the work area it can cover from there.
	- created a new function findBase to do this.

Also find a dark theme for matlab.
